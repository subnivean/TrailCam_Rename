This is a small project to rename trail camera files in order to:

1. Fix the time embedded in the filename (off by 4-5 hours due to time zone adjustment - non-configurable on the trail cam).
2. Group batches of photos so that all photos from, say, 6 pm to 9 am the next morning can all be found
   in a single folder (instead of being split up over two days).

# Steps
1. Download photos off card using Rapid Photo Downloader.
2. Run this program to rename/reorganize.
